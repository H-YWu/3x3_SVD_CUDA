# 3x3_SVD_CUDA
Fast CUDA 3x3 SVD 

This is the part of code of 

Ming Gao*, Xinlei Wang*, Kui Wu* (joint first authors), Andre Pradhana, Eftychios Sifakis, Cem Yuksel, Chenfanfu Jiang

GPU Optimization of Material Point Methods

ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH ASIA 2018), to appear.

It will produce the same result as 

â€œ[Computing the Singular Value Decomposition of 3x3 matrices with minimal branching and elementary floating point operations](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sifakis/project_pages/svd.html)" does. 

## How to use 

Though we only provide Visual Studio 2015 *.sln, the code doesn't depend on any external library.
